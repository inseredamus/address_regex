     *
     * Needed for the tests :
     *  - a Regex method : "getAddressFormated" for recognizing the housenumber and the street from the initial string
     *  - an "AddressObject" for making a structure to an address with its own street and its own housenumber
     *
     * Because of the Ã¤ (forth address), the text should be converted to UTF-8 (AddressInput.properties : is exactly a copy paste of addresses from the exercice)
     *
     * Inside the test, the jsonobject will be created in the wished format and ca be used as variable : jsonObject
     *

             As a consequence, JSON libraries are free to rearrange the order of the elements as they see fit. This is not a bug.
